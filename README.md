# Game of Bombers


## GameAPI (v.1)

Since there are quite a few bugs in the original game, Robbin tried hard to develop this API while fixing the bugs at the same time. And he decided to deliver the GameAPI in several releases.

Currently the GameAPI (1st release) offers the following functions:

+ ```GameAPI.StartGame(): void```  
 Start the bomber game.

+ ```GameAPI.StartFire(): void```  
  Let the bomber starts firing. The bomber initially does not fire.

+ ```GameAPI.CeaseFire(): void```  
  Let the bomber cease fire.

+ ```GameAPI.SetBulletSpeed(speed: Number): void```  
  Set the speed at which bullets are generated. The unit for speed is **(number of bullets)/second**. For good user experience, Robbin recommends you set a value larger than 33.

+ ```GameAPI.AllowCursorControlOnBomber(IsAllow: Boolean): void```
  This controls whether the bomber can be controlled by mouse cursor (the original game feature).

+ ```GameAPI.BomberMovesUpBy(distance: Number): void```
  Makes the bomber move up by a certain ```distance``` (unit: pixel).

+ ```GameAPI.BomberMovesDownBy(distance: Number): void```
  Similar to ```GameAPI.BomberMovesUpBy()```.

+ ```GameAPI.BomberMovesLeftBy(distance: Number): void```
  Similar to ```GameAPI.BomberMovesUpBy()```.

+ ```GameAPI.BomberMovesRightBy(distance: Number): void```
  Similar to ```GameAPI.BomberMovesUpBy()```.

  > Ans: add ```type="module"``` to script tag. it will work. See [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62783429/how-to-import-javascript-module-from-external-javascript-file-into-script-tag).
  
  e.g.
  ```js
  <script type="module">    
     import JSZip from '../node_modules/jszip/dist/jszip.min.js';
  </script>
  ```
